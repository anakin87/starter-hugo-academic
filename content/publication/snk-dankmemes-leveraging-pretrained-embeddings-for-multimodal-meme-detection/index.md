  In this paper, we describe and present the results of meme detection system,
  specifically developed and submitted for our participation to the first
  subtask of DANKMEMES (EVALITA 2020). 

  We built simple classifiers, consisting in feed forward neural networks.

  They leverage existing pretrained embeddings, both for text and image representation.

  Our best system (SNK1) achieves good results in meme detection (F1 = 0.8473), ranking 2nd in the competition, at a distance of 0.0028 from the first classified.
