  The overall dynamic behaviour of tall buildings can be estimated by means of
  equivalent beam models, and several ways of assessing this equivalence are
  presented in papers by different authors.

  The most appealing benefit of this approach is that the response of the structure to stochastic

  actions, such as wind loads, can be estimated using a model with a reduced number of degrees of

  freedom, consequently decreasing the computational costs and therefore allowing the designer to

  explore a greater variety of possible structural solutions (Cluni et al, 2013).


  In this paper, the dynamic mechanical properties of an equivalent beam able to describe the threedimensional response of a tall building are estimated with an approach which extends that proposed in Cluni et al. (2014). The resulting model can fully describe the interaction between bending, shear and torsional behaviour. 

  In particular, the approach here proposed explicitly uses the information on the sub-structures of the building to calibrate the mechanical characteristics of the equivalent beam. More in details, the frames, the shear walls and the lattice structures are identified and modelled as equivalent beams connected by rigid diaphragms at different floors. Thereafter, using an energetic approach the dynamic characteristics of the tall building are estimated (as shown in Potzta and Kollar, 2003) and used to calibrate the mechanic characteristics of the equivalent beam by means of the minimization of a suitable function of modal periods and static displacements. The modal shapes of the equivalent beam can be evaluated in closed form, and thereafter the response of the structure to wind actions is estimated with modal analysis and/or stochastic analysis.

  The results obtained with the proposed approach are finally compared both to standard Finite Element approach and to the modal approach with approximated modal shapes presented in Potzta and Kollar (2003).
