The aim of the competition was to train a ML model that would divide IT job offers into specific categories. I did a thorough study of the dataset, which allowed me to effectively clean up the original data. The model that has obtained the best performances is given by the simple combination of TF-IDF and a linear SVM, trained with stochastic gradient descent. I ranked 1st!
