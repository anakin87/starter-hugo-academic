I participated in an experimentation commissioned by Anas, aimed at developing a **low-cost IOT+ML system for predictive maintenance of road infrastructure**. Working with sensor data, I trained various neural networks in order to learn the “behavior” of the monitored infrastructure and report significant future deviations. The performance of these models completely satisfied Anas and opened the way for subsequent experiments.
